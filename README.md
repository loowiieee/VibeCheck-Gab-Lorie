This project is a simple Node.js and Express-based API with a frontend button interface developed for CPE 411L Activity #3. The backend runs on localhost and provides multiple API endpoints that return JSON responses, including fortune, joke, mood-based vibe, smash counter, and a secret endpoint. The frontend consists of an HTML page with JavaScript that uses fetch to call these endpoints and display the returned data on screen when buttons are clicked. This activity demonstrates basic server setup, API route creation, frontend–backend communication, and proper GitHub workflow using feature branches, meaningful commits, pull requests, and merges.
